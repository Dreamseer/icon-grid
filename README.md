> An iOS icon grid for Adobe Fireworks.

## About

Since everyone uses [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) nowadays while I’m
still stuck on Adobe Fireworks CS5 (yup, really), I created an iOS icon grid
for it. This repository contains:

 * an Adobe Fireworks PNG file
 * an optimized alpha-transparent 8-bit PNG file
 * an SVG file
