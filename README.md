> An iOS icon grid for Adobe Fireworks.

## About

While everyone used [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com), I was  still stucked on Adobe Fireworks CS5. So I created an iOS icon grid for it, using the infamous “squircle” shape iOS uses since iOS 7. This repository contains:

* an Adobe Fireworks PNG file
* an Affinity Designer file
* an optimized alpha-transparent 8-bit PNG file
* an SVG file
